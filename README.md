- Uncovered inventory inefficiencies: Calculated the capital tied up in unsold inventory, highlighting opportunities to improve cash flow and reduce holding costs.
- Statistically validated vendor performance: Used hypothesis testing to confirm a significant difference in profitability between top- and low-performing vendors.

**Tools & Technologies Used**

- Data Preparation: SQL (MySQL)
- Data Analysis: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy)
- Visualization & Reporting: Power BI

**How to Explore**
